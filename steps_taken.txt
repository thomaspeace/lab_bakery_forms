1.
take data out of the array and place it in a state.
the state will go within app as the state will be accessed in multiple places and we need to put it in the parent of the components accessing it.
we will need to pass the cakes as a prop to RecipeList now. put cakeList={cakes} in App.jsx for RecipeList and {cakeList} as an arguement in RecipeList

2.
add components states to cakeform
link the inputs to the states
add onSubmit to the form
add props for cakeList and setCake to App.jsx
create handleSubmit, make sure to make the object newCake using cakeName : cakeNameTrim etc...
