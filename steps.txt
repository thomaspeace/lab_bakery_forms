1
remove the data from RecipeList and add it to a service in App
this is because CakeForm will need to access and modify the data, so it must be in a parent of both RecipeList and CakeForm
the data isn't currently stored as a state, just data

2
imported App to RecipeList
pass {cakes} to RecipeList in App
