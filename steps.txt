1
remove the data from RecipeList and add it to a service in App
this is because CakeForm will need to access and modify the data, so it must be in a parent of both RecipeList and CakeForm
the data isn't currently stored as a state, just data

2
imported App to RecipeList
pass {cakes} to RecipeList in App

3 (setting up form)
add states in form for cakeName, ingredients and rating
create handleSubmit fn and add it to onSubmit in form
had to create handleCake as we can't access setCakes from CakeForm. handleCake is defined in App.jsx, so we write it there
added logic to split ingredient string by "," and trim().
